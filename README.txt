This is a version of the classic game memory.

Project goal: Create a working and fun game, while refreshing my progamming skills and learning some new on the way.

Game:
The player can choose how many cards belong to a set and how many sets they wish to find.

Status:
**Work-in-progress**
Cards are dealt according to the chosen size and number of sets. Cards are clickable and basically the game is playable. 
However, the game does not enforce rules yet. Results are not saved etc.
